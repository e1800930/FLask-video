# AC-SUM-GAN: Connecting Actor-Critic and Generative Adversarial Networks for Unsupervised Video Summarization

## PyTorch Implementation of AC-SUM-GAN
- From **"AC-SUM-GAN: Connecting Actor-Critic and Generative Adversarial Networks for Unsupervised Video Summarization"** (IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (IEEE TCSVT 2020), Early Access)
- Reimplemented by Minh Hoang

## Dependency
Run
<pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

## Generating video
To summarize videos stored in a directory, run:
<pre>
python test.py [path_to_video_dataset_folder]
</pre>

## Data
Dataset generated by ```generate_dataset.py``` have the following structure:
<pre>
/key
    /features                 2D-array with shape (n_steps, feature-dimension)
    /picks                    positions of subsampled frames in original video
    /n_frames                 number of frames in original video
    /fps                      fps of original video
    /change_points            2D-array with shape (num_segments, 2), each row stores indices of a segment
    /n_steps                  number of subsampled frames
    /video_name               original video name
</pre>
